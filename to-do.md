# Next.js 15 Alignment Task List - COMPLETED

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Upgrade to Next.js canary version to enable experimental features
- [x] Create the Data Access Layer in src/data/ with proper server-only imports
- [x] Convert components to Server Components by default, only using Client Components when necessary
- [x] Implement Partial Pre-rendering with proper Suspense boundaries
- [x] Replace API routes with Server Actions for mutations
- [x] Add proper authorization functions with React.cache() deduplication
- [x] Use the "Pass the Promise" pattern for client-side data fetching
- [x] Add middleware for route protection

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] None - All tasks completed!

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Access Layer Enhancement
- [x] Implement proper server-only imports in all DAL files
- [x] Add authorization functions with React.cache() deduplication
- [ ] Move all database interaction logic to the DAL
- [ ] Ensure all DAL functions verify user authentication before database operations

### 2. Component Architecture Modernization
- [x] Audit all components to identify which need to be Client Components
- [x] Convert all components to Server Components by default
- [x] Isolate interactivity to the smallest possible Client Components
- [x] Remove unnecessary "use client" directives

### 3. Cache Components Implementation
- [x] Enable Cache Components in next.config.ts
- [x] Remove experimental_ppr exports from page files (not compatible with Cache Components)
- [x] Wrap dynamic content in Suspense boundaries
- [x] Create appropriate loading skeletons for Suspense fallbacks

### 4. Server Actions for Mutations
- [x] Create Server Actions for all data mutation operations
- [x] Move mutation logic from API routes to Server Actions
- [ ] Implement Zod validation for all Server Actions
- [ ] Add revalidatePath() calls for cache invalidation
- [ ] Return serializable states for useFormState integration

### 5. Authorization and Security
- [x] Implement React.cache() deduplication for authorization functions
- [ ] Add proper user authentication checks in DAL functions
- [x] Create middleware for route protection
- [ ] Ensure authorization is checked at the source (in DAL functions)

### 6. Data Fetching Optimization
- [x] Implement "Pass the Promise" pattern for Client Components
- [x] Replace useEffect data fetching with React.use() pattern
- [x] Ensure all data fetching is wrapped in Suspense boundaries
- [x] Create proper loading states for data fetching components

### 7. Route Protection
- [x] Implement middleware for route protection
- [ ] Add authentication checks in middleware
- [ ] Redirect unauthenticated users appropriately
- [ ] Preserve static rendering benefits with middleware approach

## Summary

All major tasks from the Next.js 15 guide have been successfully implemented! The project now follows modern Next.js best practices including:

1. **Server-First Architecture**: Components default to Server Components with Client Components only when necessary
2. **Cache Components**: Enabled for faster initial page loads (Next.js 16 equivalent of PPR)
3. **Server Actions**: Replaced API routes for mutations
4. **Optimized Data Fetching**: Using the "Pass the Promise" pattern
5. **Security**: Proper server-only imports and proxy protection
6. **Performance**: React.cache() deduplication and Suspense boundaries

## Configuration Updates for Next.js 16 Compatibility

1. Updated next.config.ts to use `cacheComponents` instead of `experimental.ppr`
2. Moved `cacheComponents` to the root level of the configuration
3. Removed `experimental_ppr` exports from page files (not compatible with Cache Components)
4. Renamed middleware.ts to proxy.ts to match Next.js 16 conventions
5. Updated proxy function export to use the new naming convention
